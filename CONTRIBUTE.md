## Coding Style

The ``osfci`` project aims to follow the standard formatting recommendations
and language idioms set out in the [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)
guide, for example [formatting](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#formatting)
and [names](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#names).

`gofmt` and `golint` are required and will be checked during code-review.

- Example:
    ```
    gofmt -s -w ctrl1.go
    golint ctrl1.go
    ```
